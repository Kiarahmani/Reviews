rd Compositional Verification of Interruptable OS Kernels and Device Drivers 
##### (Chen et al. PLDI'16) - Review by Kia Rahmani
\
Due to their complexity, operating systems are very diffcault to verify. Recent efforts have ended up in verifying only small simplified kernels, that are far from being realistic. These projects, do not verify the drivers and are unaware of interrupts; which are in fact very difficult to verify, due to their non-determinisitic behavior. Moreover, Verification techniques used in those works, do not immediately extend for verifying interruptable kernels.
